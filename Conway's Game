The Game
The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented 
by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

                                                                         —Princeton University


This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. 
It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. 
Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

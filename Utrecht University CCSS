Utrecht University
Centre for Complex Systems Studies (CCSS)

The Centre for Complex Systems Studies (CCSS) approaches societal challenges with theories and models from the natural sciences. 
Many of these social issues are not yet fully understood. One of the challenges the researchers face is that even a small change
in one of the variables can have significant impact on the whole. At Utrecht University we try to model these complex systems for 
a better understanding of the spreading of infectious diseases, climate change, networks and big data.

Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) is a general purpose network analysis and graph mining library. 
It is written in C++ and easily scales to massive networks with hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges. 
It efficiently manipulates large graphs, calculates structural properties, generates regular and random graphs, 
and supports attributes on nodes and edges. SNAP is also available through the NodeXL which is a graphical front-end 
that integrates network analysis into Microsoft Office and Excel.

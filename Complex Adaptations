Complex Adaptations
https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/energy/adaptations-complex-systems.php

Complex Systems often span multiple organisations, which requires that components act autonomously
in a decentralised manner, as each organisation may have disparate and possibly contradictory goals and technologies.

Adaptation is a fundamental requirement to achieve this as both the scale of these systems and the
heterogeneity of goals necessitate a reactive and proactive approach.

Conference onComplex Systems 2024

20 years of CCS
Welcome to the 20th Conference on Complex Systems, CCS2024! The CCS is the flagship annual meeting for the complex systems research community, 
operating within the framework of the Complex Systems Society. This special 20th anniversary conference is jointly organised by Northeastern University London 
and the University of Exeter.

We welcome participants looking to appreciate the connection with the multidisciplinary community that CCS brings together. 
In this 20th edition of the conference we welcome young researchers for a warm-up session in beautiful London, 
followed by the main conference just a train ride away in Exeter.

This edition takes place after previous events held in Salvador da Bahia 2023, Mallorca 2022, Lyon 2021, Online 2020,
Singapore 2019, Thessaloniki 2018 and Cancun 2017.

ON THE EMERGING FUTURE OF COMPLEXITY SCIENCES
Ubiquity, Volume 2006 

Complexity as a phenomenon is omnipresent in natural, social, business, artificial, engineered or hybrid systems.
Cells, organisms, the ecosystem, companies, supply networks, markets, societies, governments, cities, regions, 
countries, large scale software and hardware systems, the Internet, all are examples of complex systems. 
Despite this omnipresence there is no commonly accepted, crisp and robust definition or classification of
complex systems and one might ask why we would expect commonalities among such systems despite their obvious differences.

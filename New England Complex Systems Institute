New England Complex Systems Institute

https://necsi.edu/about

The New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) is an independent academic research and educational institution with students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty.
In addition to the in-house research team, NECSI has co-faculty, students and affiliates from MIT, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities nationally and internationally.

NECSI has been instrumental in the development of complex systems science and its applications. We study how interactions within a system lead to its behavioral patterns, 
and how the system interacts with its environment. Our new tools overcome the limitations of classical approximations for the scientific study of complex systems, 
such as social organizations, biological organisms and ecological communities. NECSI's unified mathematically-based approach transcends the boundaries of physical, 
biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, management, and medicine.

NECSI research advances fundamental science and its applications to real world problems, including social policy matters. NECSI researchers study networks, 
agent-based modeling, multiscale analysis and complexity, chaos and predictability, evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, 
health care, systems engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development. (see NECSI Research).

NECSI conducts classes, seminars and conferences to assist students, faculty and professionals in their understanding of complex systems. 
NECSI sponsors postdoctoral fellows, provides research resources online, and hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems. 
Through its education, NECSI strives to contribute to science and the betterment of society (see NECSI Education).

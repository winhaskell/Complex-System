Teaching About Complex Systems

Understanding the Earth system is one of the fundamental challenges, and rewards, 
of being a geoscientist. The dynamic, non-linear, interdependent behavior inherent in
complex systems poses particular challenges for teaching and learning. 


What Is a Complex System?
The study of complex systems in the geosciences encompasses a broad range of topics, 
including the interactions of the various "spheres" (atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere), 
cycles, feedback loops, and chaotic and fractal behavior within earth systems. Read an introduction 
to complex systems, with detailed descriptions of the defining characteristics of complex systems, 
supplemented by several additional definitions of complexity.


Systems Thinking in the Geosciences
The Earth is a complex system, composed of many interacting subsystems. Understanding the behavior 
of these complex systems is both essential and counter-intuitive (e.g. Manduca and Kastens, 2012; Stillings, 2012). 
For our students to develop such an understanding, we need to introduce them to systems thinking in the geosciences.


Teaching Systems Thinking
The Place of Systems Thinking in the Curriculum
Because of its complexity, systems thinking is best developed through multiple examples in multiple contexts.

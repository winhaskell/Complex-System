Complex Adaptive Systems

“The study of how living and nonliving things organize themselves into patterns and interact as emergent systems 
is the basis for the science of complexity. Complexity is extremely multidisciplinary and involves scientists in a 
vast assortment of fields from Biology to Physics. It is also closely related to Fractal Geometry and Chaos Theory. 

Chaos is a new scientific theory for dealing with systems that are complex, unpredictable, and/or have random events, 
or, in other words, most of the real world. Natural systems are so complicated that no matter how carefully 
we measure them, we can’t know everything about them. Although measurements can be extremely accurate, they can’t be 
accurate to infinity, and tiny differences/errors in the beginning can lead to gigantic ones later. 

This is known as the Butterfly Effect, because under the right circumstances, the effect of the fluttering of 
a butterfly’s wings can make the difference between whether or not there will be a tornado.(So much for ever getting 
accurate weather predictions.)This shows how even the actions of the smallest creature can have a large effect 
on the whole. In ecological systems, everything is connected”

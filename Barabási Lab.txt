The Center for Complex Network Research (CCNR), directed by Professor Albert-L치szl칩 Barab치si, 
has a simple objective: think networks. The center's research focuses on how networks emerge, 
what they look like, and how they evolve; and how networks impact on understanding of complex systems. 

To understand networks, CCNR's research has developed to rather unexpected areas. 
Certain studies include the topology of the www - showing that webpages are on average 19 clicks form each other; 
complex cellular network inside the cell-looking at both metabolic and genetic networks; 
the Internet's Achilles' Heel. 
The center's researchers have even ventured to study how actors are connected in Hollywood.
